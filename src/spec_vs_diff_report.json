However, required generated image assets are not present in the diff, and additional Internet Identity/auth + actor/react-query infrastructure was added despite being out of scope (no auth flows requested).",

      "requirement": "Add the required generated images as static assets under frontend/public/assets/generated and render them in the page (hero illustration and subtle background pattern).",
      "reason": "The app references the background pattern by URL, but the diff does not add the required image files under frontend/public/assets/generated (including the hero image). Without the assets present in the repository, the acceptance criteria that the images exist with specified filenames and load in production is not met based on this diff.",
