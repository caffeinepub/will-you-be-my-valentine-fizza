# Specification

## Summary
**Goal:** Build a single-page Valentine-themed “Will you be my valentine fizza?” site with a cohesive Valentine + pizza visual theme and playful Yes/No interactions.

**Planned changes:**
- Create a responsive single-page layout that prominently shows the headline “Will you be my valentine fizza?” plus a short English subtitle/instruction.
- Add accessible “Yes” and “No” buttons with keyboard support and visible focus states.
- Implement playful interaction states: “Yes” triggers a celebratory success view; “No” triggers a non-destructive, encouraging reaction.
- Apply a consistent Valentine + pizza (“fizza”) design system (colors/typography/spacing/components) avoiding a blue/purple-dominant palette.
- Add and render required generated images from `frontend/public/assets/generated` (hero illustration + subtle repeating background pattern).

**User-visible outcome:** On mobile or desktop, users see the Valentine “fizza” prompt with themed visuals and can choose Yes or No to trigger fun, accessible reactions and a celebration state.
